<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The "Papyrus of Heron" project is an exploration into the world of sorting algorithms, inspired by the legendary figure of Heron of Alexandria and his quest to organize the vast collection of knowledge in the Great Library of Alexandria during the 1st century AD.

We work on seven differents algorithm:

* Selection Sort
* Bubble Sort
* Insertion Sort 
* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort
* Heap Sort
* Comb Sort 

The graphical interface displays a color wheel where each color is represented by a value in an array, and the sorting is performed in real-time to show the sorting process.
